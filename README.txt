the[dun]geon is a RNG RPG text-based rogue-like made by eldrfoa in September of 2020.

Those are rules of the game.

Tagging system is made so that you can change basically everything in the text files of the game (only in three folders chargen, eventgen, storygen)
You can delete and rewrite them in anyway you want, although you must always use apropriate tags and follow the order of columns. How to use tags is in the tagging section below, and how to follow the order of columns is in the documentation section way over there.

If you have an idea that goes out over those boundaries, feel send it to me or discuss it over the Discord server, and it could be added to the next build of the game!

Ok so...

columns - if columns of text in the files separated by a blank line - RETAIN IT
black line mustn't contain even a space " ", not a single symbol. Additionaly after the last column there should be no blank line.

"|", ":" and "," are dividers inside a line. Try to mimic other lines to create a working new one.

I recommend using Notepad++, because some lines are very long and a default notepad with a word-wrap can confuse you with one line being on several lines. Notepad++ numerates lines, so it's easier to understand where it's a new line or a very lone one, but wraped around.
