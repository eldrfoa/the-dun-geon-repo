[char] was walking down a long [rooma] corridor lit with occasional torches. [charp] entered a room, that had [num] [fura] [furs], the room itself was quite [rooma].
As [char] went further on, the dungeon walls narrowed and in one place [charp] had to squeeze between them to get through. [char] saw a [doora] door and entered it.

[char] was hobbling down a long [rooma] corridor lit with occasional torches. [charp] entered a room, that had [num] [fura] [furs], the room itself was quite [rooma].
The light wound from a previous fight made [char] hobble towards the next room. As [charp] entered that [rooma] room, [charp] immediately saw some [fura] [furs]. One [fur] in the middle there.
Recovering from the last injury, [char] went on in this dungeon in [rooma] corridor, until [charp] saw a [doora] door. [charp] limped in.

[char] was limping down a long [rooma] corridor lit with occasional torches. [charp] entered a room, that had [num] [fura] [fur], the room itself was quite [rooma].
Badly injured from the last fray. [char] limped in the next room, that was hidden behind [doora] door.

There, in the corner, [char] saw a friendly face. Adventuring [comr] met [char] with a warm greeting. [compp] name was [com].
[char] looked around, noticing a person there. [comr] came closer and greeted [char]. [comr] [name] [com] [smiled].
Another adventurer was in that [rooma] room. It was [comr] [name] [com]. [char] smiled and they shook hands.

[char] talked to [com] about it, but couldn't persuade [compr].
Heroes chatted a bit, [char] even asked [com] to come with [charpr], but [comp] refused.
Seeking their own glory [com] exchanged pleasantries and went on adventuring in this maze of a dungeon.
Being not very good with words, [char] couldn't persuade [comr] to accompany [charpr].

[char] talked to [com] and [comp] agreed to join [charpr] in [charpp] adventure. In [compp] hands, [com] held [compp] trusty [comw]
"You have my [comw]" - said the [comr] [smil]. [comp] agreed to accompany [char] in this dungeon.
[com] thought for a moment, but [char]'s words vere full of wisdom. Surviving alone is a bad idea.
[comr] [name] [com] [smiled] and agreed to come with [char], helping [charpr] in [charpp] quest.

[com] said, that [comp] was adventuring here, pretty much like [char]. Having exchanged pleasantries [com] walked away, leaving [char] alone.
[com] said, that [comp] was trying to find [compp] way out of this dungeon. [char] pointed [compr] in the right direction.

It was a travelling merchant, [char] took a peek at [com]'s wares.
[com] [smiled] warmly and told [char] that [comp] is a travelling merchant. [com] showed hero [compp] wares.
Collecting antiquities, travelling mecrhant introduced [compr]self as [com], showing [char] [compp] wares.

Even if our hero wanted to buy something, [charp] didn't have enough money. [comr] merchant named [com] shrugged [compp] shoulders and went away.
Taking a good look at all the things, [com] had in store, [char] refused to buy anything and left. [com] sighed and wandered away.
No willing to buy anything perhaps becuase [char] was short on gold, or maybe [com] didn't have anything interesting in store, [comp] went away without a deal.
Fortune wasn't on [comr] side, as [char] didn't buy anything, so [com] left [charpr] alone in that [rooma] room.

Being happy to sell something in this god-forsaken place [comr] shook [char]'s hand and wandered away.
[com] thanked the fortune for being able to trade in this dark corner of the world. Shook hands with [char] [comp] went away.

Inside this room there was an old chest, covered in cobwebs. [char] cautiously came closer and opened it. There was gold in it!

Leaned against one of the walls in that room, there stood a weapon rack. [char] noticed a weapon on it, abandoned by someone.
In the darkest corner there was an old covered in web shelf. On it a weapon, abandoned by everyone.

[char] entered a room and saw an angry [creat]. It immideately started to approach [char].
In the dimly lit room there was an angry [creat]. It turned its head towards [char].

It seemed that [creat] lived here, and now, disturbed by [char]'s presense, it was going to kill [charpr].
[creat] dwelled there, with gnawing hatred to an unwelcomed guests. [char] prepared to fight.
It was the den of [creat], willing to kill and probably eat [char]. Its anger could not be pacified.

[char] thought that [creat] was smart enough not to get into conflict, so instead of fighting [charp] tried to persuade [creatpr]. [creat] heard the voice of reason and walked away.
[char] decided to calm [creat] down. Soothingly explaining to it, that [charp] meant no harm. [creat] grunted, but walked away, convinced no to fight.
[char] tried to reason with the [creat], and to [charpr] own surprise it listened and left the room.

[char] thought that [creat] was smart enough not to get into conflict, so instead of fighting [charp] tried to persuade [creatpr]. But all this talk only made [creat] angrier.
Carefully picking words, [char] tried to reason with the [creat], but it just wouldn't listen. It moved forward and grunted angrily.

[char] rushed to the door and ran away in fear, [creat] couldn't chase [charpr] down.
Overwhelmed with fear [char] ran away as fast as [charp] could. Leaving [creat] in that place.
